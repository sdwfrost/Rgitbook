\description{
This function will build Rmarkdown files in the given directory to markdown.
The default is to traverse all subdirectories of the working directory
looking for .Rmd files to process. This function will save a file in the
working directory called \code{.rmdbuild} that contain the status of the
last successful build. This allows the function to only process changed files.
